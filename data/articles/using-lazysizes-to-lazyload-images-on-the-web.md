Images constitute a large portion of the page weights of a lot of Web pages. They make our pages more enjoyable to look at, but can also hurt our page load times especially when they have large file sizes or when there are a lot of them on the page, not to mention that they can unnecessarily consume our usersâ€™ bandwidths. One way to deal with these concerns is to **lazyload** our images.

Lazyloading means that we load our images only when they are going to be visible in the page. For example, an image located somewhere near the end of a long article doesnâ€™t need to be loaded until the user actually scrolls it into view.

We can implement our own lazyloading functionality with JavaScript using some modern Web APIs (such as the [Intersection Observer API][1]), or use an image lazyloading library like [**lazysizes**][2] by [aFarkas][3]. What I like about this library is that it is very easy to start using it, and is performant while being packed with tons of amazing features.

# Example Web page

Letâ€™s create an example Web page with an image which we want to lazyload later on with lazysizes. Our example page is going to have the following markup:

```html
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p>
<!-- 9 more lorem ipsum paragraphs -->

<img src="image.jpg" alt="Sample Image">

<!-- 3 more lorem ipsum paragraphs -->
```

Notice from DevToolsâ€™ Network tab that the image has already been loaded since the page has loaded. Letâ€™s try to change that to only load it when it is about to scroll into view using lazysizes.

# Basic usage

To start using lazysizes, the first thing we need to do is load the lazysizes JavaScript file:

```html
<script src="http://afarkas.github.io/lazysizes/lazysizes.min.js"></script>
```

It can also be installed via npm (`npm install lazysizes`) or bower (`bower install lazysizes`).

Second, we modify the `img` tags that we want to lazyload to:
1. Use `data-src` attribute instead of `src`, and
2. Add `lazyload` as one of its classes

```html
<!-- Before: -->
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Sample Image">

<!-- After: -->
<img data-src="image.jpg" class="lazyload" alt="Sample Image">
```

And the result?

Notice from DevToolsâ€™ Network tab how the image is only loaded once itâ€™s about to be scrolled into view. Awesome!

# Lazyload responsive images

We can serve responsive images on the Web using the `srcset` attribute on the `img` element or using the `picture` element. This allows us to serve an appropriately-sized image to our users depending on their screen sizes.

One really cool feature of lazysizes that I really like is its ability to lazyload these responsive images without any additional configuration. All we have to do is to replace the `srcset` attribute with `data-srcset`.

```html
<!-- Before: -->
<img
    srcset="
        image-100.jpg 100w,
        image-300.jpg 300w"
    src="image.jpg"
    alt="Responsive Image"
>

<-- After: -->
<img
    data-srcset="
        image-100.jpg 100w,
        image-300.jpg 300w"
    data-src="image.jpg"
    alt="Responsive Image"
>
```

# Use a low-quality image placeholder

One potential concern with our lazyloaded images at this point is that when the userâ€™s network connection is slow, it will still take a long time for the images to show up, leaving us with a blank space in our page.

We can address this by displaying a small-sized, low-quality image as a placeholder until the actual image finishes loading. Because of its very small size, this placeholder image will load very quickly, giving the user an idea of what the actual image is going to look like. To do that, we add the placeholder image as the `src` attribute of the `img` tag.

```html
<img
    data-srcset="
        image-100.jpg 100w,
        image-300.jpg 300w"
    data-src="image.jpg"
    src="image-lqip.jpg"  <!-- eg a 20px-wide image -->
    width="300"
    height="200"
    alt="Responsive Image"
>
```

Adding the `width` and `height` attributes makes the small-sized image take up the space of the actual image. This can also be done via CSS.

# Summary

So far weâ€™ve looked at how to use lazysizes to lazyload images for basic use cases. With the changes weâ€™ve made, users will get to download the images in our page only when necessary. As a result, our page loads faster since it doesnâ€™t need to wait for the large image to finish loading. We also keep the users from unnecessarily consuming their bandwidths on images that theyâ€™re not going to see yet.

However, weâ€™ve only scratched the surface of what lazysizes offers. It offers much more features and different configurations and other patterns of how it can be used for more advanced use cases, so definitely check out the libraryâ€™s [documentation][2] for those, and letâ€™s all make our Web experiences better together by lazyloading our images.
