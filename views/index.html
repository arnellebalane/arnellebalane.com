            </header>

            <p>Just like other developers, I write code. They're all scattered across the Internet, but you can find most of the cool ones in my <a href="https://github.com/arnellebalane" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github profile</a>. Some of them are also in <a href="https://codepen.io/arnellebalane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Codepen</a>, and even on <a href="#">this site</a>.</p>

            <p>Here are some things that I've worked on recently:</p>

            <p>I also write blog posts about random things that I learned or tried out recently. They're mostly Web stuff. If you're interested to read some of them, you can do so at <a href="http://blog.arnellebalane.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my blog</a>.</p>

            <p>Here's the last thing I posted on my blog:</p>

            <blockquote cite="https://blog.arnellebalane.com/the-web-share-api-2cbb3e6cf007">

            </blockquote>

            <p>Occasionally, I give talks and do workshops about Web-related technologies, like Javascript or Progressive Web Apps. You can find slides to my previous talks in <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/arnellebalane" target="_blank" rel="noopenter">Speaker Deck</a>.</p>

            <p>Supposedly this paragraph will tell you about my upcoming talk, but I don't have one at the moment.</p>
